## Instruction

Build a simple application to showcase your skills in:

1. Building complex UIs [done]

2. Api Integration [done]

3. State Management with the Provider Package [done]

Note: Please use the MVVM architecture to architect this application.

Build a simple user registration, login, and dashboard feature with any simple ui of your choice. Use any available public API to fetch a list of books when the user logs into the application, then store that data and display those books to the user when they click on a button on their dashboard to show the books.

Use the Provider package to store and update data.
